Release History:

1/5/08: 
Very alpha release.  Barely functions. I only released this to give some idea of what
it would do.  LOTS to do.

1/6/08:
Fixed much of the cusrsor handling routine. Line and column counters work. Using BASIC
routines for window and scroll control.

1/10/08:
Drop down menus are now appearing, thanks to the Transactor magazine. Try C= F and C=E
to see the new drop down menus.
